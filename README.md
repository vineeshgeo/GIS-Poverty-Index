Multidimensional Poverty Index: A GIS-Based Pattern Analysis
The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) combined with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can provide a powerful tool for pattern analysis. By overlaying MPI data with spatial data layers such as population density, infrastructure, and environmental factors, GIS can reveal spatial patterns and relationships that help policymakers target interventions more effectively. It allows for the identification of areas with high levels of multidimensional poverty and helps in understanding the underlying factors contributing to poverty in those areas. This approach enables more targeted and evidence-based decision-making for poverty alleviation efforts.
